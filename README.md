### Description

Hi friends,this is a scientific calculator designed and developed by Rajiv V Jathan

actually this is the upgraded version of the Scientific calculator created by my own my friend Priyank R Panchal.

We enjoy doing such stuffs.

Right now we are working on a project for a small firm.

This calculator is not perfect i accept that.Currently it can perform operations with two operands only (a+b and not a+b+c).So please mail some feedback on this calculator

to rajiv_load@yahoo.co.in

hope u enjoyed it.............
